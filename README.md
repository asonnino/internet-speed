Automatically measure and plot average internet speed. 

## Install & Run
First, install [speedtest-cli](https://github.com/sivel/speedtest-cli) as described [here](https://github.com/sivel/speedtest-cli#installation). Give appropriate permissions to the script `speedtest.sh`:
```
$ chmod +x speedtest.sh
```
Set a `cron` job to regularly trigger the script. For instance, if your script is located in `/root` and you want to trigger it hourly, you can set:
```
@hourly bash /root/speedtest.sh
```
Data will be collected in a file colled `speedtest.json` in the same directory.

## Plot
You can run the Matlab script `script.mlx` to plot the average internet speed versus the hours of the day. You can edit the script to set the theoretical download & upload speed as below:
```
% download theoretical speed
th_download = 20;
% upload theoretical speed
th_upload = 1;
```
